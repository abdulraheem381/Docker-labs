# ⚛️ Project 06 – React + NGINX (Multi-Stage Docker Build)

This project demonstrates how to build and serve a **React application** using a **multi-stage Docker build**.  
The frontend is built with Node.js and served using the **NGINX web server** in a lightweight production container.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- React (Frontend UI)
- Node.js (Build Stage)
- NGINX (Static server)
- Docker (Multi-stage build)
