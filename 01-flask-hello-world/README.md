You're absolutely right, Abdul — thanks for pointing that out. The README you have now is **raw YAML pasted into a `.md` file**, which causes:

* **Poor formatting** on GitHub
* No syntax highlighting
* Hard to read as a typical `README.md`

---

## ✅ What You *Should* Do Instead

Keep **two files**:

### ✅ 1. A standard `README.md` (for GitHub display)

Formatted with headings, code blocks, links, etc. — looks clean.

### ✅ 2. A `README.yaml` or `meta.yaml` (optional, for automation)

If you want to parse it programmatically or feed it into a dashboard/tool later.

## ✅ Correct `README.md` (Use This for GitHub)

```markdown
# 🐍 Project 01 – Flask Hello World (Dockerized)

This is a minimal **Flask web application** containerized using **Docker**. It returns a simple "Hello from Flask in Docker!" message when accessed.
